    "What is Tomato Mosaic Virus?": """
**Tomato Mosaic Virus: Causes, Symptoms, and Management**

**Introduction**
Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) is a highly contagious viral disease affecting tomatoes, caused by a strain of the tobacco mosaic virus. It can lead to significant yield loss and reduced fruit quality.

**Causes of Tomato Mosaic Virus**
The virus is spread by mechanical means, such as handling plants, contaminated tools, and seeds. It can persist in plant debris, soil, and on surfaces for long periods.

**Symptoms of Tomato Mosaic Virus**
- **Leaf Symptoms:** Mottling, yellowing, and curling of the leaves, often leading to a "fern-like" appearance. Infected plants may be stunted and less vigorous.
- **Fruit Symptoms:** Infected plants may produce fewer, smaller fruits with uneven ripening and poor flavor.

**Management of Tomato Mosaic Virus**
- **Sanitation:** Disinfect tools, hands, and surfaces after handling plants to prevent the spread of the virus.
- **Resistant Varieties:** Plant tomato varieties that are resistant to ToMV.
- **Crop Rotation:** Rotate tomatoes with non-host crops to reduce the buildup of the virus in the soil.

**Conclusion**
Managing tomato mosaic virus requires strict sanitation practices, the use of resistant varieties, and crop rotation to protect tomato crops from significant losses.
