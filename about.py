    I am <b>Francis Vishal Nirosh</b>, a final-year student pursuing a BSc in Software Engineering. The <b>Plant Disease Recognition System</b> is my capstone project, developed to assist in the early detection and prevention of plant diseases. This system is designed for farmers, researchers, and anyone involved in agriculture who wants to monitor plant health and take preventive measures early on.

    The Plant Disease Recognition System is built using cutting-edge machine learning models that analyze images of plants to detect any signs of disease. By simply uploading an image of a potentially infected plant, the system identifies patterns and symptoms to provide accurate disease diagnosis. The ultimate goal is to offer fast, reliable, and actionable information to help users protect their crops and improve agricultural yields.

    The dataset used for this project has been carefully curated and augmented offline from the original dataset to improve model accuracy and robustness. The dataset is structured into three parts:
    </div>
    
    <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
        <li><b>Train:</b> 70,295 images used to train the machine learning model.</li>
        <li><b>Test:</b> 33 images to evaluate model performance during development.</li>
        <li><b>Validation:</b> 17,572 images to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.</li>
